# Restaurant App

## Overview

Welcome to the Restaurant App, an intuitive web application built with PHP. This project represents my final raw PHP endeavor, aiming to replicate the ordering process of a real-life restaurant, inspired by the likes of McDonald's.

**Note:** This application is optimized for larger screens and may not provide an optimal experience on mobile devices.

## Features

Here's a breakdown of the key features of this Restaurant App:

### 1. Interactive Ordering

The app mimics the experience of ordering food at a physical restaurant by a large screen. On entering the application, you'll find a product list.

- To add items to your order, simply click the "Add to Order" button beneath each product.
- Your selected items will be displayed in the cart, located in the top right corner of the screen.

### 2. Order Number System

After completing your order and making a payment with your card(this is the feature that is still not made), you will be assigned an order number. This number is crucial, as it helps you identify and collect your order.

### 3. Category Sorting

To streamline your product selection, you can categorize the product list by choosing a specific category. This feature enhances the user experience and makes navigation more convenient.

### 4. Order Number Cycling

The application uses an intelligent algorithm to manage order numbers efficiently. It cycles through numbers from 1 to 100 and resets to 1 once it reaches 100. This system ensures smooth order processing and tracking.

### 5. Order Status

The second screen of the application provides a real-time overview of all orders that have not been claimed, completed, or are still in preparation. You'll notice that your order number turns green when your order is ready for pickup.

### 6. Admin Dashboard

The third screen is dedicated to administrators, giving them control over various aspects of the application:

- **Product Management:** Admins can add, edit, or remove products from the menu.
- **Order Management:** Administrators have access to a list of pending orders and can mark them as complete or remove them once customers have collected their orders.

## Getting Started

To start using the Restaurant App, access it on a device with a larger screen for the best experience. Begin by exploring the product list, selecting your desired items, and adding them to your cart. Remember your order number for quick order retrieval.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **PHP Backend:** Handles order processing, product management, and admin functionalities.
- **Database:** Stores product information, orders, and order statuses.
- **Frontend:** Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for customers and administrators.

## Conclusion

The Restaurant App offers a unique and interactive way to order food online but in real life :), closely resembling the experience of dining in a restaurant. Whether you're a customer looking to place an order or an admin managing the restaurant's operations, this app provides a comprehensive solution for both.

Thank you for exploring the Restaurant App, and we hope you have a delightful ordering experience!
